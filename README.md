# GP-Spiking-Data

In this work, we studied the oscillatory synchrony between GP neurons and the cortical EEG in parkinsonian rats in two states: Active and Slow Wave Activity. According to our results, two major populations of GPe neurons are distinguished by their distinct temporal activities (such as firing at different phases) shown in the slow wave activity of parkinsonian animals.

In order to process and analyze the data we used a set of Python scripts in Jupyter Notebook which is available in this repository.
